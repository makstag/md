#### 1. C++2a
##### § 6.9.1.8 (стр 84)
An expression _X_ is said to be sequenced before an expression _Y_ if every value computation and every side effect associated with the expression _X_ is sequenced before every value computation and every side effect associated with the expression _Y_.
##### § 7.6.2.3 (стр 134)
The result is the updated operand; it is
an lvalue, and it is a bit-field if the operand is a bit-field. The expression ++x is equivalent to x+=1.
##### § 7.6.19 (стр 153)
In all cases, the assignment is sequenced after the value computation of the right and left operands, and before the value computation of the assignment expression. The right operand is sequenced before the left operand.

#### 2. C++17 n4659
##### 8.18 
Assignment and compound assignment operators
an lvalue, and it is a bit-field if the operand is a bit-field. The expression ++x is equivalent to x+=1.

#### 3. C++11 C++14 n3242 n4296 
##### `§1.9/14` `(стр 10)`
Every value computation and side effect associated with a full-expression is sequenced before every value computation and side effect associated with the next full-expression to be evaluated. Example:

```C++
int x; x = 10; ++x;
```
##### §1.9/15 (стр 10)
The value computations of the operands of an operator are sequenced before the value computation of the result of the operator. If a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to either another side effect on the same scalar object or a value computation using the value of the same scalar object, the behavior is undefined.
Evaluation of an expression (or a sub-expression) in general includes both value computations (including determining the identity of an object for glvalue evaluation and fetching a value previously assigned to an object for prvalue evaluation) and initiation of side effects.
1. Except where noted, evaluations of operands of individual operators and of subexpressions of individual expressions are unsequenced.
2. The value computations of the operands of an operator are sequenced before the value computation of the result of the operator.
3. If a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to either (a) another side effect on the same scalar object or (b) a value computation using the value of the same scalar object. The behaviour is undefined.

```C++
i = i++ * ++i;     // Undefined Behaviour
i = ++i + i++;     // Undefined Behaviour
i = ++i + ++i;     // Undefined Behaviour
i = v[i++];        // Undefined Behaviour
a[++i] = i;        // Undefined Behaviour
i = i++ + 1;       // Undefined Behaviour
f(i = -1, i = -1); // Undefined Behaviour
i = v[++i]:        // Well-defined Behaviour
i = ++i + 1;       // Well-defined Behaviour
++++i;             // Well-defined Behaviour
```

When calling a function (whether or not the function is inline), every value computation and side effect associated with any argument expression, or with the postfix expression designating the called function, is sequenced before execution of every expression or statement in the body of the called function. 

#### 4. C, C++98 и C++03 n1638
##### §5/4 (стр 66)
1. Between the previous and next sequence point a scalar object shall have its stored value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.
2. Furthermore, the prior value shall be accessed only to determine the value to be stored.

```C++
i++ * ++i;   // Undefined Behaviour, i is modified more than once btw two SPs
i = ++i;     // `Undefined Behaviour``, same as above
++i = 2;     // `Undefined Behaviour``, same as above
i = ++i + 1; // `Undefined Behaviour``, same as above
++++i;       // `Undefined Behaviour``, parsed as (++(++i))

i = (i, ++i, ++i); // UB, there's no SP between `++i` (right most) and assignment to `i` (`i` is modified more than once btw two Sps)
```
